Slack is used for all three examples in Socket Mode so you can interact with your AI agent in a thread.

Setup:

- create a new slack app from slack-manifest.json
- install into workspace
- create an app token with connections:write perms
- set both SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (starts with xobx-) and SLACK_APP_TOKEN (starts with xapp-) as environment variables
